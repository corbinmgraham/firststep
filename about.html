                    firststep was born as a modern refresh of all which remained of <1st_Step>.  With exciting new titles coming soon, the future looks bright for this rebrand.
                    As demand grows, firststep will continue to come out with new, modern applications.

                    <1st_Step> Website Development was founded some time in 2011 by Corbin Graham with the goal of simplifying web design.
                    This was a time when getting a website was a difficult task.  It required knowledge of HTML as well as funding for a domain and hosting.
                    With no plans of hosting and a lack of funding, <1st_Step> Website Development was an HTML-only company to design web fronts and share the source with customers to later be hosted.
                    When products started being released that allowed for custom web page creation without any knowledge of HTML, it was game over.
                    <br><br>

                    Thus, a spin-off was born: <1st_Step> Game Development.  They later merged as <1st_Step> Development.
                    <br>
                    In this time period, <1st_Step> Game Development produced such games and apps as: <a href="">Text Batch</a>, <a href="">Kingdom Doom</a>, and others.
                    While they were popular within a small community, they were never successful enough to be profitable and served as projects for ideas and innovation.
                    Text Batch served as inspiration for firststep's upcoming app, Text.
                    This will be a new productivity application for multi-source encrypted network messaging using Corbin Graham's new <a href="">Connect.</a> library.
